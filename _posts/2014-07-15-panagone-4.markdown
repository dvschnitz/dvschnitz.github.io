description: For the lecture Exploratives Design, we created a so-called newsgame. The target of this game is to communicate aspects of the Panama papers with the usage of game mechanics. The game was tested and developed with several lo-fi prototypes, later I translated the mechanics into a polished game with the usage of Adobe Photoshop.
