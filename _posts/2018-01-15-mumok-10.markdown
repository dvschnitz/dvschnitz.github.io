description: For my diploma thesis with the title "Casual Information Visualization on Mobile Devices considering the Museum Context" I designed and implemented a mobile museum visualization. Afterward it the was tested with 21 participants in the modern art museum mumok. <br><br>The cross-platform application was implemented in <b>Ionic</b>. For the visualization part <b>D3.js</b>, ngx-charts and Google Maps were used. To get additional information about an artwork and the artist, users can scan the artwork's label with the device's camera.
