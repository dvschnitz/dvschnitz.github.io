description: This App shows translations from Italian to English for terms in the Card Game Magic the Gathering©. You can navigate to the three different sections Types, Creatures, and Keywords with a click on the bottom menu or through swipes. <br>Currently the app is only available for Android, however, I made it with the cross-platform technology Flutter so a future iOS version is no problem. The app is free and contains no ads. <br><br><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.schnitzhofer.david.italian_magic"><b>Download here in Playstore</b></a><br><br><b>App Content</b><br><br><b>Tipi - Types</b><br>Artefatto,Artifact<br>carta,card<br>Creatura,Creature<br>danni,damage<br>Incantesimo,Enchantment<br>Instantaneo,Instant<br>Terra,Land<br>Leggenda,Legend<br>Planeswalker,Planeswalker<br>giocatore,player<br>Stregonaria,Sorcery<br>Evoca,Summon<br>bersaglio,target<br>Terre,Lands<br>Foresta,Forest<br>Isola,Island<br>Montagna,Mountain<br>Palude,Swamp<br>Pianura,Plains<br>             <br><b>Creatura - Creatures</b><br>Angelo,Angel<br>Arpia,Harpy<br>Avatar,Avatar<br>Barbaro,Barbarian<br>Bestia,Beast<br>Bue,Ox<br>Cavaliere,Knight<br>Cavallo,Horse<br>Centauro,Centaur<br>Cinghiale,Boar<br>Costrutto,Construct<br>Demone,Demon<br>Diavolo,Devil<br>Dinosauro,Dinosaur<br>Dio,God<br>Draghetto,Drake<br>Drago,Dragon<br>Druido,Druid<br>Eldrazi,Eldrazi<br>Elefante,Elephant<br>Elementale,Elemental<br>Elfo,Elf<br>Farabutto,Rogue<br>Felino,Cat<br>Fenice,Phoenix<br>Gigante,Giant<br>Goblin,Goblin<br>Golem,Golem<br>Guerriero,Warrior<br>Idra,Hydra<br>Illusione,Illusion<br>Imp,Imp<br>Insetto,Insect<br>Juggernaut,Juggernaut<br>Kavu,Kavu<br>Lucertola,Lizard<br>Lupo,Wolf<br>Mago,Wizard<br>Mannaro,Werewolf<br>Melma,Ooze<br>Minotauro,Minotaur<br>Monaco,Monk<br>Muro,Wall<br>Mutamagia,Faerie<br>Mutante,Mutant<br>Myr,Myr<br>Ninfa,Nymph<br>Ninja,Ninja<br>Ogre,Ogre<br>Orrore,Horror<br>Orso,Bear<br>Pecora,Sheep<br>Pesce,Fish<br>Pianta,Plant<br>Piovra,Octopus<br>Pirata,Pirate<br>Polimorfo,Shapeshifter<br>Ragno,Spider<br>Ratto,Rat<br>Ribelle,Rebel<br>Rinoceronte,Rhino<br>Samurai,Samurai<br>Sciamano,Hound<br>Sciamano,Shaman<br>Segugio,Nightmare<br>Serpente,Snake<br>Servitore,Minion<br>Silvantropo,Treefolk<br>Sirena,Siren<br>Soldato,Soldier<br>Spettro,Specter<br>Spirito,Spirit<br>Tottero,Thopter<br>Tramutante,Sliver<br>Tritone,Merfolk<br>Troll,Troll<br>Uccello,Bird<br>Umano,Human<br>Unicorno,Unicorn<br>Vampiro,Vampire<br>Verme,Worm<br>Viashino,Viashino<br>Volpe,Fox<br>Zombie,Zombie<br>          <br><b>Parole chiave - Keywords</b><br>Aldilà,Afterlife<br>Accelerare,Dash {2}{B} (You may cast this spell for its dash cost.
