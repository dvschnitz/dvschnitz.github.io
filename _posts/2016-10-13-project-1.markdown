description: “Quantangled” is a tribute to a quantum phenomenon called entanglement. First discovered by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen in 1935 this “spooky action at a distance” still is one of the biggest mysteries in quantum mechanics and amazes the minds of physicists around the world. We took this entanglement and tried to craft it into a challenging game concept.<br><br>“Quantangled” is a top down maze puzzle, where you control two to four different particles at the same time. The clou is that inactive particles can go through walls, while the active ones collide with it. To solve the levels you have to make the switches at the right time and the right position. <br><br>The topic of last semester’s explorative design lecture at TU Wien was all about games. We started with a card game, followed by a board game, two puzzle computer games and a social game. The prototype for the quantum puzzle game was created in collaboration with quantum physicists from the University of Vienna. Based on that prototype we reimplemented the mechanics in HTML5 and added more levels. It is designed to be a plausible puzzle for casual gamers but it is also a tough challenge for sophisticated mind gamers if they try to finish all levels with the minimum amount of switches.<br><br><b>Team Schrödingers Matratze</b><br><a href="mailto:benjaminhoeller@gmx.at">Benajmin Höller</a><br><a href="mailto:birgit.chmelar@live.de">Birgit Chmelar</a><br><a href="http://david.schnitzhofer.at/">David Schnitzhofer</a>
